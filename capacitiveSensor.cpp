*CapitiveSense Library Demo Sketch
*One small sheet of aluminium foil is used as a one side of a capacitor plate
*Other one side would be our hand
*Uses a high value resistor e.g. 1 megohm between send pin and receive pin
*Pin4(PD4) is used as the Sendpin.1M ohm resistor is connected via this pin to one end of
*Pin3 is connected from other other end of the foil to ground
*Pin8 is used for the buzzer
